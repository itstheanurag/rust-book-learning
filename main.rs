fn main() {
    println!("Hello suckers!");
}

/*
 The `main` function is the entry point of every Rust executable program.
 Execution of the program starts from here.

 `println!` is a macro (not a function).
 Macros in Rust end with `!` and can take any number of arguments.
 This macro prints text to the console, followed by a newline.
